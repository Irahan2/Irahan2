# 👋 Hi, I'm Caner

An **Engineering Student** passionate about **AI, Machine Learning, and Intelligent Systems**.  
I enjoy combining theory with hands-on projects, from data-driven applications to practical implementations that bridge research and real-world impact.  

I share my projects and resources here to help others learn and to showcase my growth in the field.

---

### 🔭 What I’m working on
- Exploring **Machine Learning & AI** across multiple domains (vision, data science, automation)  
- Developing **end-to-end ML pipelines**: preprocessing → training → evaluation → deployment  
- Building **real-time and scalable systems** that connect software with practical applications  
- Continuously learning and experimenting with new tools, frameworks, and methods

### 🌟 Featured Projects
- **[NeuroPark – 3D Vehicle Detection & Depth Estimation](https://github.com/Irahan2/NeuroPark-3D-Vehicle-Detection)**  
  Real-time vehicle detection (YOLOv8) + monocular depth (MiDaS) + calibration → **3D bounding boxes on point clouds**  

- **[Parking Detection System](https://github.com/Irahan2/Parking-Detection-System)**  
  YOLO + OpenCV system to detect parked vehicles and **count free/occupied slots** with threshold alerts  

- **[Machine Learning Roadmap](https://github.com/Irahan2/ml-roadmap)**  
  Step-by-step notebooks (NumPy → Pandas → Visualization → Preprocessing → End-to-End Project).  
  A practical ML learning resource that is **continuously updated**.
