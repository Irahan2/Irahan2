# 👋 Hey, I'm Caner  

I'm a **Data & ML Engineer** exploring the path from  
**data processing & statistics** → **machine learning models** → **applied AI systems** (computer vision, GenAI, LangChain).  

---

## 🔧 What I’m working on
- 🗂 **Data & SQL** – preprocessing, analysis, and pipelines  
- 📊 **Machine Learning** – classical ML, statistics, end-to-end projects  
- 👁 **Applied AI** – computer vision, YOLOv8, Open3D, image processing  
- 🤖 **Generative AI** – LangChain, RAG, autonomous agents  

---

✨ Always learning, experimenting, and building real-world projects at the intersection of **Data, ML, and AI**.
